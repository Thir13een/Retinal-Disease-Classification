# Deep Learning Model for Classification

This project implements a deep learning model for classification tasks, focusing on training and evaluating the model using standard techniques such as loss/accuracy plots, confusion matrix, and classification reports.

## Files

- **run.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook with model training and evaluation code.
- **Training and validation plots**: Visualizes the accuracy and loss of the model over time.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Provides insights into the model's performance for each class.
- **Classification Report**: Includes precision, recall, and F1 scores for each class.

## Instructions

1. Clone this repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Open the Jupyter notebook: `jupyter notebook Code.ipynb`
3. Run the notebook to train the model and evaluate its performance.

## Model Details

- **Architecture**: Define a neural network using PyTorch, including layers such as convolutional, fully connected, and activation layers.
- **Dataset**: Uses a custom dataset loader with PyTorch's `DataLoader` for training and validation sets.
- **Evaluation**: The model is evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
